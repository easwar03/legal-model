# Legal Document Analysis

## INTRODUCTION
This progress report outlines the current status of the Legal Document Analysis Project, detailing changes, accomplished tasks, and future plans.

## CHANGES
### Hugging Face Integration
Initial prototypes for basic analysis functionalities were developed using various LLMs hosted by Hugging Face instead of GPT-3 due to better suitability for this project.

### Functionality Implementation
- **Summarisation**: Implemented using `Falconsai/text_summarization`, a T5 transformer-based pre-trained model.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Implemented using `siebert/sentiment-roberta-large-english`, a BERT-based pre-trained model. Fine-tuning of this model was implemented.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Implemented using `dslim/bert-large-NER`, also a BERT-based pre-trained model.

## ACCOMPLISHED TASKS
- **Tokenization and Dataset Preparation**: The dataset from the GLUE benchmark (SST-2) was tokenized and prepared for model training and evaluation.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: A sentiment analysis model (`siebert/sentiment-roberta-large-english`) was fine-tuned and evaluated.
- **Pipelines Setup**: Pipelines for summarization, sentiment analysis, and NER were set up and tested on sample texts from the dataset.

## FUTURE PLANS
### Advanced Techniques and Model Development
- **Implement Advanced Techniques**: Refine the summarization, sentiment analysis, and NER functionalities to more advanced functionalities, possibly more general text classification.
- **Model Evaluation, Selection, and Fine-tuning**: Evaluate and select models according to new requirements and further fine-tune them to the task at hand.

### Testing and Validation
- **Testing Protocols**: Develop and execute testing protocols to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the system.
- **Validation Techniques**: Implement validation techniques to verify the performance of the system on various legal document datasets.
